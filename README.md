# nmrcv
A dedicated repository for managing the controlled vocabulary supporting nmrML format

The purpose of the current work is to obtain a namespace for NMRCV under the OBOFoundry.

Robot tool was used to generate an error report and address as many issues as possible.

Some errors such as identical classes with multiple identifiers can not be fixed without addressing the issue of class imports from CHEBI.
